# Design for Physical Prototyping


## Read me
Only edit the content in the [content/docs/projects/our_project]({{< ref "our_project" >}}) folder. This is also the folder to be handed in at the end of the semester. Rename the folder to your projects title. The total size should not exceed **20 MB**. GIFs are encouraged to demonstrate movement in your prototype. 
The current content content provides an exemplary structure for the documentation but can be freely adapted to your needs. Write in a way so that the documentation would be useful for your pre-project self.
