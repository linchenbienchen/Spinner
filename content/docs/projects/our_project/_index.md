# Bottle Spinner

## Abstract

The Bottle Spinner is a device tackling the issue of commercially available bottles holding shampoo, soap or even honey and glue.
Often times the consumer cannot empty the bottle whole, as the last few scraps will always get stuck on the bottom of the bottle.
This device solves this issue by using centrifugal force to bring all of the contents of these bottles to the opening of these bottles.

The Bottle Spinner uses centrifugal force to bring all of the contents of shampoo bottles or even substances like honey or glue to the front of the bottle.
